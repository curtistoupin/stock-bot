#stock-bot
This project is a collection of tools developed to investigate potential indicators for stock trends.

There is a LSTM machine learning model (still under development) which is being trained to take in past stock prices and predict the stock's price some number of days in the future.

There is also a number of tools intended to investigate the relative strength index, or RSI. A stock's RSI is often touted by amateur investors as a good indicator of future stock trends. Conventional wisdom says that when a stock's RSI is above 70, it is "overbought" and will soon experience a price drop. Conversely an RSI below 30 indicates a stock is "oversold" and will soon experience an uptick. This idea does not appear to be the case, and the tools in RSI_sim.py can be used to see this.

Investigations of more potential indicators as well as developments to the LSTM are planned for the future.
